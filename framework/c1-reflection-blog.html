    <p>The video on the DBC/EDA programme in America answered a lot of questions that I had pondered over the last week.
    </p>
    <p>My first impressions were a mix of inspiration and fear.
    </p>
    <p>I could see myself engaging in this type of culture, I've always been a team sport player.
    </p>
    <p>My expectations have changed since watching the video, I initially thought I was dining at a restaurant, but now I realise I'm cooking at home and will get out of it what I put in.
    </p>
    <p>I am intrigued to see if I can strive in this type of environment as it will be stepping outside of my confort zone.
    </p>
    <p>A lot of aspects of this course make me very nervous.
