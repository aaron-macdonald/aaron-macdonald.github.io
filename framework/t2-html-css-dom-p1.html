      <h2>What is Boxifying Design</h2>
      <p>Boxifying design is dividing a mockup into rectangle boxes so that it aligns with the Box Model
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2>What is the Box Model</h2>
      <p>The Box Model is a concept in which every element on a page is a rectangular box and may have width, height, padding borders, and margins.
      </p>
      <p> Because there are multiple widths and heights based on the width and height of each of the content, the border and the padding elements, the boz sizing property simplifies things by defining which width/height is fixed and adjusting other widths and heights accordingly.</p>
