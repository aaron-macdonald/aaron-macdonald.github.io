        <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
          <p>I have lived predominantly with the pleasure lens on but have found passion/flow in sport and coaching. About 6 years ago I got involved in my softball club committee and was surprised how good I felt getting involved and helping make the club run. This was definately a 'purpose' experiance</p>
          <p> </p>
        <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values? What do you stand for?</h4>
          <p>A core value for me is kindness. I don't like seeing anyone or anything being mis-treated.</p>
          <p>If I stand for anything, which I'm not sure I do, it's most likely fairness.</p>
        <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
          <p>This was a timely exercise for me as my reilience has been waning over the last two weeks and I have let the work get on top of me a bit.</p>
          <p>I'm surprised how beneficial the cultural part of the course is. It's a weekly checkup for the soul.</p>
        <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
          <p>Two references to Michael Jordan this week ... excellent.</p>
          <p>Loved hearing that even genius's feel stupid some times ... gives the rest of us hope.</p>

          <h4>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
            <p>For me, it's not getting blocked that triggers the emotional responses, it's delaying going through the issue resolution process that we have learnt that winds me up.   </p>
            <p>I'm a very process orientated person, so it's very important that I develop processes and implement them.</p>
          <h4>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
            <p>It was great. More useful at the moment for my marriage and coaching sport, as there is little to none personal interaction with phase 0.</p>
            <p>But none the less, implementing the techniques learnt from the "Search Inside Yourself" and learning how to interact with people better will ultimately be beneficial in a work environment.</p>

        <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
          <p>For me, mindfulness is an input that self awareness processes. Good input and a good processor leads to good output</p>
        <h4> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
          <p>I found body scanning a bit weird but with everything going on at the moment it was nice to clear the noise in my head.</p>
        <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>
          <p>I enjoyed this section as I can often stigmatise myself with negative generalisations that are not good for my well-being. I also liked the clouds in the sky example as it's visual and simplistic</p>

          <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
            <p>I have mindful-like conversations with my two boys a lot, as I think it is really important that they know someone is really listening to them.</p>
          <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
            <p>I like the idea of 'looping' as it helps identify if both parties are on the same page. I imagine this is a very useful trait in the world of coding in a team environment.</p>
          <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
            <p>I'm married so I get busted not listening all the time ... must stop just saying 'Yes Dear' ! </p>

          <div>
            <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
              <p>Process over product keeps me focused on the job at hand and helps me not 'go down the rabit hole'.
              </p>
            <h4>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?"</h4>
              <p>I considered meditation as probably a good thing to do but not for me.</p>
            <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation</h4>
              <p>I have learnt that meditation is about mental training and in particular, mindful meditation trains 'attention and meta-attention.'</p>
            <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
              <p>I will practice the breathing process as linked below ... can't hurt and from what I read has multiple benefits</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Become aware of in breath, out breath, and space in between.</li>

                  <li>(Short pause)</li>

                  <li>If you like, you can think of this exercise as resting the mind on the breath. You can visualize the breath to be a resting place, or a cushion, or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it, very gently. Just be.</li>

                  <li>(Long pause)</li>

                  <li>If at any time you feel distracted by a sensation, thought, or sound, just acknowledge it,experience it, and very gently let it go. Bring your attention very gently back to the breathing.</li>

                  <li>(Long pause)</li>

                  <li>If you like, let us end this meditation by inviting joyful inner peace to arise.</li>

                  <li>Breathing in, I am calm.</li>

                  <li>Breathing out, I smile.</li>

                  <li>This present moment,</li>

                  <li>Wonderful.</li>

                  <li>(Short pause)</li>

                  <li>Thank you for your attention.</li>
                </ul>

          <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
            <p>It was an enjoyable read with the quirky references.</p>
            <p>I like the notion of Calmness, Clarity and Joy</p>

              <h4>What learnings did I get from reading chapter one of the book "Search Inside Yourself"</h4>
                <p>
                  I found out what Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is ... which is a good start
                </p>
                <p>
                  I found a list, and I like lists
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Self-awareness: Knowledge of one's internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions</li>
                  <li>Self-regulation: Management of one's internal states, impulses, and resources</li>
                  <li>MotivationL Emotional tendancies that guide or facilitate reaching goals</li>
                  <li>Empathy: Awareness of others' feelings, needs, and concerns</li>
                  <li>Social Skills: Adeptness to indicing desirable responses in others</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  I liked heairng that EQ is a skill that can be improved with training
                </P>

        <h2>DBC/EDA</h2>
            <p>
              The video on the DBC/EDA programme in America answered a lot of questions that I had pondered over the last week.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first impressions were a mix of inspiration and fear.
            </p>
            <p>
              I could see myself engaging in this type of culture, I've always been a team sport player.
            </p>
            <p>
              My expectations have changed since watching the video, I initially thought I was dining at a restaurant, but now I realise I'm cooking at home and will get out of it what I put in.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am intrigued to see if I can strive in this type of environment as it will be stepping outside of my confort zone.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of aspects of this course make me very nervous.
