        <h2>HTML, CSS and the DOM</h2>

        <h4>Design and Structural Wishlist</h4>
        <h4>HTML</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Webpage Structure</li>
            <li>Navigation Sections</li>
            <li>Divisions / Spans / Sections</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>CSS</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The cascade and specificity</li>
              <li>Floats and Blocks</li>
              <li>Reusable Layouts</li>
            </ul>

          <h4>HTML, CSS and the DOM</h4>
          <p>Webpages consist of HTML (the meat and potatoes), CSS (the plating) and the DOM (what the diner receives)
          </p>

          <h4>What is Boxifying Design</h4>
          <p>Boxifying design is dividing a mockup into rectangle boxes so that it aligns with the Box Model
          </p>


          <h4>What is the Box Model</h4>
          <p>The Box Model is a concept in which every element on a page is a rectangular box and may have width, height, padding borders, and margins.
          </p>
          <p> Because there are multiple widths and heights based on the width and height of each of the content, the border and the padding elements, the boz sizing property simplifies things by defining which width/height is fixed and adjusting other widths and heights accordingly.</p>

          <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>

            <h4>What is grid based design</h4>
            <p>Grid based design is organising a web page so that it is appealing to the user via a top-down, left to right, grid based flow.</p>

            <h4>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>
            <p>Responsive webpages are required as there are many different devices viewing webpages.</p>

            <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>
            <p>Semantic structure is using tags that make sense to the user and the browser. They help to ensure the code is formatted in a way that is easily understandable to another user. </p>

            <h4>In addition</h4>
            <p>I loved the heading "Your problem has been solved". Over the last two days I have lived on Google looking for answers to issues while sorting out my duel boot.</p>
            <p>I also want to puit an "Overflow" in somewhere... as it looks like good useful tech</p>

              <h2>Had a good week implementing the skelton css into my site making it responsive</h2>

                <h4>What is responsive site design, and why is it important? </h4>
                <p>Responsive site design is adding or referencing some css that adjusts your webite width and other features dependant on the size of the screen (in pixels) that is viewing your page.</p>

                <h4>What is mobile first design, and why is it important?</h4>
                <p>A higher percentage of web content is getting viewed primarily or only on mobile phones and similar smaller devices such as tablets. Mobile first design is gesigning your site with mobile in mind and working outwards, in terms of screen size, to the traditional desktop sized resolution. </p>

                <h4>What are frameworks, and what are the pros and cons. </h4>
                <p>Frameworks for webpages are similar to frameworks for building a house. Each time a builder builds a house they use commonly accepted and standard methods for constructing the frame of the house. Similarly web developers don't need to start from scratch or reinvent the wheel everytime they start a new webpage, they can use pre-constructed packages of html, css and js as a starting point for the new webpage.</p>

                <h4>What are wireframes and why are they used?</h4>
                <p>Wireframes are used to plan the structure and content layout iof your website prior to adding the actual content.</p>

              <h4>What aspect of wireframes did I find difficult and why </h4>
                <p>I found wireframing useful and a natural progression towards web design, The most difficult part for me was adding the images as I have previously not worked with images.</p>

                <h2>Javascript... Javascript... Javascript!</h4>

                  <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
                    <p>HTML puts the content on the webpage (text, images, lists, tables et), CSS makes it look good (headers, backgrounds, borders etc) and Javascript makes it interactive (logins, popups, database queries etc)</p>

                  <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h4>
                    <p>Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.  </p>
                    <p>In basketball, players follow moves similarly using a control flow, Billy gets open, Jonny passes to Billy, Jonny cuts, Billy looks for a pass to Jonny. </p>
                    <p>A loop is a sequence of instruction's that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
                    <p>In the basketball example above, if Billy can't get a pass to Jonny, Bobby gets open, Billy passes to Bobby, Billy cuts and Bobby looks for a pass to Billy.<p>
                    <p>The loop continues until it is broken by a certain condition. For example, a pass to the cutting player, a steal by the opposition, time is up.</p>

                  <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
                    <p>Objects store data via a reference title (parameter), ie name, height, sex. Arrays store data via a reference position identified by these brackets [], starting with position [0]</p>
                    <p>To access data from an object you ask for the value associated with a specific parameter, ie, what is Billy's height.</p>
                    <p>To access data from an array, you need to know what position the data is in the array. ie, for Billy's height we would ask for the value stored in position [1] of the array (as 'name' is in position [0])</p>
                  <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
                    <p>Functions are pieces of code that carry out a particular action and can be reused with different inputs</p>
                    <p>The example above is part of a basketball 'move' called "5-out", which is basically a funtion that the basketball team executes</p>
                    <p>The move outlines 5 starting positions what each player does in each of those five positions</p>
                    <p>To break it down:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The move is an object with the followign parameters: position1, position2, position3, position4, position5</li>
                      <li>The move is also a fuinction that describes what each player does in each position</li>
                      <li>The 5 players can be arranged in any order [in essence an array of 5] and take up the positions (1-5) in order and carry out the instructions for that position, regardless of which position it is</li>
                    </ul>
              </div>
