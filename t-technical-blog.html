            <br>
            <h5 class="blue-text text-darken-4">Got blocked on a simple problem</h5>
              <p>I mostly get blocked (stuck with an issue when coding) on two things</p>
                <ul class="collection">
                  <li class="collection-item">small syntax errors like using a coma instead of a semi-colon or leaving out a closing bracket</li>
                  <li class="collection-item">knowing what I want to do but not knowing the correct syntax (way to structure the code)</li>
                </ul>
            <h5 class="blue-text text-darken-4">Solved a problem in an elegant way </h5>
              <p>As with most peaople I imagine, the longer it takes to get un-blocked, the more stressed and frustrated I get</p>
              <p>For the examples above:</p>
                <ul class="collection">
                  <li class="collection-item">Using the browser debugger I can normally find the small syntax errors quite quickly as it highlights where the code is broken. Although, missing brackets often shows the code breaking past the place where the bracket is missing, so this can take a little longer</li>
                  <li class="collection-item">Syntax issues takes a lot longer as I need to find a reference on how to use a particular piece of code. I often google for pieces of syntax or use reference links, but I'm not that good at reading syntax structure yet. I also keep useful code from tutorial examples and reference them with meaningful titles so I can refer back to them. If that fails I take a nosey look at what the other members of the cohort have done as a last resort</li>
                </ul>
            <h5 class="blue-text text-darken-4">Common methods for getting un-blocked and my progress using each method are:</h5>
              <ul class="collection">
                <li class="collection-item">Pseudocode - writing out what you want to do using common language</li>
                <li class="collection-item">Trying something - [ctrl-z] is your friend and I have always been an advocate of just have a go and see what happens</li>
                <li class="collection-item">Rubber ducky method - will get back to yah</li>
                <li class="collection-item">Reading error messages - not as useful at this stage as they cna be quite technical</li>
                <li class="collection-item">Console.logging - very useful at this stage as it visually returns the outcome so it can be checked against what you think it should be returning</li>
                <li class="collection-item">Googling - the term "Your problem has been solved" introduced in week 2, is great to remember and can save a lot of time when blocked</li>
                <li class="collection-item">Asking your peers for help - do this! People are good and don't mind helping. Teaching is also a great way to learn and is beneficial to the teacher as well</li>
                <li class="collection-item">Asking your coaches for help - haven't needed to do this yet</li>
                <li class="collection-item">Improving your provess with reflection - I would like to permanently bookmark Mondays for reflection day as it is so beneficial to stop and look over what I have learned recently and throughout the course</li>
              </ul>
            <h5 class="blue-text text-darken-4">Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</h5>
              <ul class="collection">
                <li class="collection-item">.map() - creates a new array from an existing array by passing each element of the original array through a function</li>
                <li class="collection-item">.fiilter() - creates a new array from an existing array by filtering each element based on a condition</li>
                <li class="collection-item">.reduce() - passes each element through a function adjusting an initial 'accumulator' each time to return a single value</li>
                <li class="collection-item">.find() - find a specific value in an array</li>

              <h5 class="blue-text text-darken-4">How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
                <ul class="collection">
                  <li class="collection-item">HTML puts the content on the webpage (text, images, lists, tables et), CSS makes it look good (headers, backgrounds, borders etc) and Javascript makes it interactive (logins, popups, database queries etc)</li>
                </ul>
              <h5 class="blue-text text-darken-4">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h5>
                <ul class="collection">
                  <li class="collection-item">Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.  </li>
                  <li class="collection-item">In basketball, players follow moves similarly using a control flow, Billy gets open, Jonny passes to Billy, Jonny cuts, Billy looks for a pass to Jonny. </li>
                  <li class="collection-item">A loop is a sequence of instruction's that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
                  <li class="collection-item">In the basketball example above, if Billy can't get a pass to Jonny, Bobby gets open, Billy passes to Bobby, Billy cuts and Bobby looks for a pass to Billy.</li>
                  <li class="collection-item">The loop continues until it is broken by a certain condition. For example, a pass to the cutting player, a steal by the opposition, time is up.</li>
                </ul>
              <h5 class="blue-text text-darken-4">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
                <ul class="collection">
                  <li class="collection-item">Objects store data via a reference title (parameter), ie name, height, sex. Arrays store data via a reference position identified by these brackets [], starting with position [0]</li>
                  <li class="collection-item">To access data from an object you ask for the value associated with a specific parameter, ie, what is Billy's height.</li>
                  <li class="collection-item">To access data from an array, you need to know what position the data is in the array. ie, for Billy's height we would ask for the value stored in position [1] of the array (as 'name' is in position [0])</li>
                </ul>
              <h5 class="blue-text text-darken-4">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
                <ul class="collection">
                  <li class="collection-item">Functions are pieces of code that carry out a particular action and can be reused with different inputs</li>
                  <li class="collection-item">The example above is part of a basketball 'move' called "5-out", which is basically a funtion that the basketball team executes</li>
                  <li class="collection-item">The move outlines 5 starting positions what each player does in each of those five positions</li>
                  <li class="collection-item">To break it down:</li>
                    <ul class="collection">
                      <li class="collection-item">The move is an object with the followign parameters: position1, position2, position3, position4, position5</li>
                      <li class="collection-item">The move is also a fuinction that describes what each player does in each position</li>
                      <li class="collection-item">The 5 players can be arranged in any order [in essence an array of 5] and take up the positions (1-5) in order and carry out the instructions for that position, regardless of which position it is</li>

                <ul class="collection">
                  <li class="collection-item">Responsive site design is adding or referencing some css that adjusts your webite width and other features dependant on the size of the screen (in pixels) that is viewing your page.</li>

                  <li class="collection-item">A higher percentage of web content is getting viewed primarily or only on mobile phones and similar smaller devices such as tablets. Mobile first design is gesigning your site with mobile in mind and working outwards, in terms of screen size, to the traditional desktop sized resolution. </li>

                <ul class="collection">
                  <li class="collection-item">Frameworks for webpages are similar to frameworks for building a house. Each time a builder builds a house they use commonly accepted and standard methods for constructing the frame of the house. Similarly web developers don't need to start from scratch or reinvent the wheel everytime they start a new webpage, they can use pre-constructed packages of html, css and js as a starting point for the new webpage.</li>
